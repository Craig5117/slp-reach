## Usage

To begin using SLP Reach, you will need to set up your student list and goals list. This is done by clicking on the New Student and New Goal buttons respectively. By default, three SLP goals are included. When you click the button, you will be presented with a form to enter information. For students, simply enter a name and click "Save New Student". For goals, enter a goal name and goal description, then click "Save New Goal". 

Once you have at least one student, you are ready to begin adding their data. Select the student you want to work with from the student drop down menu. The name that the menu displays is the student you are currently working with. After selecting a student, add a goal for the student by selecting a goal from the Goal drop down menu. 

Once you have at least one goal on the page, you can record session trial data for that student. Click the "Take Data" button on the desired goal and you will be presented with a form. On the take data form, you will enter the date of the session, the number of trials attempted, and the number that were answered correctly. Once you have entered the session data, click "Save New Data" and the new session data will be added to the goal on that student's page. 

SLP Reach currently uses localStorage to save your data, so any data that you enter will be stored on the device you are using. Clearing your browser data will erase your data. 

That's it. Simple and functional. Keep all of your student goal data organized on your tablet or pc and don't worry with handling multiple sheets, clipboards, or notebooks.
